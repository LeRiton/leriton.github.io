Well, not for me. Because of this fuckin' school, and in addition of our courses, we must pass this english exam. However we have plenty of time, just 40 hours a week at school, over-sized programing projects and about eight exams in one week just after holidays. Just do it Â©.

For those who don't know the <a href="http://www.cambridgeesol.fr/exams/fce.cfm" title="Site du FCE" hreflang="fr">FCE</a>, just a few explanations. It's not a basic exam, but a diploma. It means that it won't take us just a few hours, but the next two saturdays. I sayed we were lucky... It includes 5 tests, like oral or use of english, so no chance to bluff (Really? We're gonna try!). So let's take your flute and work your tablatures, we will succeed tomorrow!
